      By using LegalUpaay, you acknowledge that the legal professionals listed are not employees or agents of LegalUpaay. While we require these professionals to provide basic information about their qualifications, we do not independently verify this information and make no claims regarding the qualifications of any listed legal professional. No listing on our platform, nor any information or answers provided by any legal professional, constitutes an endorsement or referral.
      
      Legal professionals are responsible for accurately representing their credentials, including the jurisdictions in which they are licensed and their standing. We encourage users to conduct their own research and due diligence regarding the qualifications of any legal professional they consider.
      
      LegalUpaay does not make any claims about the quality of services provided by any legal professional listed on our platform being superior to those of others. We strongly advise potential clients to perform independent evaluations and investigations before engaging any legal professional.</p>
